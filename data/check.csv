Need to be more transparent on policies,36
Your financial growth will be totally depends on your relationship with your leads who are working in xpanxion for more than 10+ years.,24
not think of any right now,1
People speak in Marathi most of the time. Some people are really mean Too much work,10
- Package revision is very less even if you work very hard all the time - Many employees are allocated in multiple projects and asked to contribute more than their capacity - Some employees don't get enough recognition while some set of employees receive ,17
No job security. If you are bench for long time. you may be asked to leave,10
Recruitment team - not responsibe,14
There is always a scope of improvement but no cons as such.,8
Nothing As of now.Everything is good for me.,1
No cons all things looks good.,22
Less Projects and Onsite opportunity,0
"Not a big giant company, less onsite opportunities",0
management needs to be improved.,36
From last few years Management started thinking in different direction which leads irregular and less increments.,28
No COns as of now. Can add canteen,22
onsite opportunities are not that much,0
Quite an open environment. You can walk up to anyone for your queries,26
Small scale company otherwise no cons as such,22
Nothing i can think of,1
No cons according to me.,22
"Multi-location means you'll have to ask the HR where you'll be placed during the interview. Also, if your project changes or shifts to a different location, you'll have to deal with location change. Some projects have different internal culture. If you are placed in a project where your clients comes online during your evening hours, you'll probably have to stretch your working hours.",2
"Typical service based culture, client is god No benefits apart from salary.",16
Not too many good projects,2
Yet to explore just started there,27
You need to log 45 hrs a week compulsory even if you are done with your work. Very few projects with excellent tech stack.,36
1. Company uses outdated technology. 2. Not much growth opportunity.,0
Overall Management can be improved a bit,3
No strong downside that I came across.,4
"No onsite opportunity, too much hierarchy",0
I did not found any while I was working in this company,20
"Like every coin has two sides, this one also does. The biggest problem in XP is the amount of favouritism management has to those who is good at bootlicking. They will straight away give power to those who don't even deserve it. This has lead to high attrition rate in last few years and imbalance in talent and majority of folks left are performing same donkey work. Many if leadership folks also left for similar reasons.",2
Not came as of now,4
Low salary hikes. Biased higher management,35
No cons as such I know,22
Less/ no on site opportunity NA,0
"As it is acquired by UST, they are involving in financial matters and hence it's affecting XP employees in terms of hike, bonus etc",32
I have not come across any cons,22
You are asked to work on old technology inspite of your experience. Poor management of resources.,18

Politics like single led kingdom,18
Lesser flexibility to move in other projects and technologies,23
Nothing to say on this,1
Onsite opportunities are very poor in xpanxion,0

"Nothing, everything is good overall.",6
To much politics inside teams,18
Need more publicity of the organization!,36
Transportation facility is not available,9
none that i can think of,29
1. It is not a big issue but you have to maintain 45 hours weekly. 2. No cab facility.,12
Not at this point of time.,10
Havent experienced any till date .,20
Politics. No time for family. Every 6 month you will be tested based on your skills and hike depends on that.,33
as far as now no downsize.,11
1.No work life balance in many projects. 2. Pathetic food in cafeteria. 3. No breakfast and dinner is available. 4. Micromanagement to an extent.,13
"Initially management was good,Managers HR ETC atleast work environment was good but now its just FAKE. HIRE and FIRE ..NO salary Hike..They give you hike of 2% - 3%..Which is negligible. Everybody is playing politics for their own benefit and demotivate you and no chances of growth. Until you are following their rules, they are good and once you ask for something eg.Salary,Project change or any work from home,long leaves etc behaviour will completely change.. When client will escalate you for some reason without your mistake, Management will not support you for sure. Now new management is too bad. Not much learning also.All projects are just going. Complete JOB INSECURITY.",32
trying to grow fast leading to issues,12
"Nothing goes in a planned way, no structure in the org",1
Did not observe till now,5
Hampers your work life balance,13
Manager don't have sense to talk with the employee. Don't provide KT to the new joiners and expect that they should learn the project by themselves... isn't it manager duty to atleast provide one KT about the project to the new joiners Project is good but I don't know what the manager thinks of herself Why don't they understand that new joiners also need some time to go through the project and learn about the project..,2
1. Less/No onsite opportunity 2. No other concerns,0
technical recruiter not good need change,14
Not growing as per their abilities.,12
Don't go at client side,15
Nothing much. Haven't observed anything,1
"Cross platform integration, new tools of QA.",23
"They have office in Aundh and near RTO-Camp. I wish they had a single tower , in the middle of the city",26
Working at client location of Xpanxion is not that great as you miss on all the benefits of the company,16
Management not good. If u r at client side then they will be delay in decisions.,15
Worst Work Environment. CEO S.Ramprasad needs training on People management. High Attrition in HR team. Extreme politics in Support Functions. HR Managers need training on People Management,26
"Partiality, local domination, arrogant management, no focus/vision",25
"Some projects are too hectic, no work life balance at all, no help from management",13
- 0 Onsite opportunity. - Not big growth even its 16 years old company because CEO's do not want to expand business on large scale. - No excuse if you fail in project / daily task / Client escalations - Following process is sometime burden. - Project hour,17
They don't have project on latest upcoming java technology basically that depends on current project,36
Very weak leadership. Very high attrition. Spineless HR leadership who only say Yes to what business says. Top leadership is worst...they should actually retire but they do not want to leave their cushy job.,35
None as such to mention here,29
Poor management and lots of politics,18
- Work/Life Balance sucks in Pune Office. - Not much growth opportunities - People who have spent more time in company are considered more valuable and more intelligent than newcomers - Administration and Support Team(IT & Non IT) both are ineffective and,17
As with all companies Xpanxion is not a perfect company. There are opportunities for improvement and that is where I reach out to our Senior Management for providing suggestions. There are constant changes in policies and procedures and processes but I think that is a sign of a growing company as changes are inevitable.,3
"1. Food in pantry might be free but it can be healthier, it's usually fried snacks. 2. Infrastructure in the aundh office is old but the one at Pune station is good, again no game room in aundh office, a TV in the pantry or canteen will be great :). 3. The AHM or town halls can be boring, the management needs to make it more interesting so that people understand where the company is moving and where it is now. 4. Work life balance 5. Poor integration between the various locations especially for training, need to invest in technology there. 6. In the aundh office there are hardly any conference rooms most of them are cabins, it's difficult to conduct meetings as the rooms are always booked. 7. Small IT team for the size of the company, they are excellent but human, might need to think about increasing strength.",36
"Though there are no any negatives per say, however onsite opportunities are quite limited. Apart from this i do not see any other area that should concern anyone.",0
Small teams hence sometimes you are on your own. But the seniors in the organization are willing to help. The focus seems to be on the teams in US. Hopefully it should change.,28
1. Zero onsite. 2. No big accounts. 3. They install software(sapian) on machine to keep watch on you. 4. Micro management(Depending on project) 5. No work life balance in some projects. 6. There are lot of criteria to get 100% rating but still they don't check that while giving appraisals. 7. For Senior employees job security is issue. without any notice they will throw you outside.,13
"I take interviews in the organization. Most of the times, the interview request is adhoc. A meeting request should be sent for the same at least one day in advance.",34
Although once in a while but I do not like the fact that at times org activities take precedence over delivery,32
Sometimes they expect too much from the resources. You don't have any reason to fail to perform. They generally don't allow work from home.,0
sometimes processes are too slow.,28
Other projects were really good. Good scope for QA,2
Not so far as of I know.,11
"Not as such, like anywhere else talk about your work to get appraised fairly if lead or pm fails to notice it.",8
No cons as. Such to say,22
No cons I can see till now..,22
"I wish I could have given a 0 star. The worst company they postponed our joining twice they gave us offer letter twice made us sign that and also made us do assignments and then terminated us before the joining date which was given for the third time . They waisted our whole one year made us wait for the whole 2017 and then terminated us, such a fraud.",25
Transportation is currently not available,9
Need a good coffee machine.,14
#NAME?,19
"Difficult to mention, don't find any",5
Nothing as such. You need to work for 9 hrs,21
Not any cons found till the date,20
Cant think of any at this point of time,10
We can work on professional certifications,24
No onsite No transport Less compensation as per industry standard,9
Regional politics Some managers are partial towards specific set of people,18
No challenging work at some project,2
Parking issue is there for everyone,7
No medical insurance from company. Premium gets deducted from salary,35
Only for managers... Managers favors upcoming managers who can work for them and do their work.... Micromanagement is growing day by day... No one is looking at working staff satisfaction...,24
"not that important, can be compromised",11
"1. Being a small scale company they don't have so many projects. 2. On multiple projects, you have to be on you toes at every moment. 3. Not great internal hikes. 4. Layoff can happen at any moment.",2
No cons as management is really supportive,22
don't think any cons such as,22
All good. I have not seen any cons.,5
"They will watching you min by min, they have a tool which they say is good for employees productivity, but work less managers will be watching your computer usage, application usage and activity level, they have all the data what you are doing ans so.",2
HR Team is bit weak,3
I couldnt find any cons yet,27
No such any in my openion,5
Nothing to comment as such.,21
no cons as such,22
"Managers thinks that they have hired a robot who can do anything they want him to do. No quality work. Startup like culture and environment. Though you have done with all your tasks, you have to be in the office for 9 hours daily. 45 Hours a week. Or salary will be deducted as per less hours. Manager calls you anytime.",34
lack of new technologies here,23
growth in terms of carrier and money is not good for QA. Salary increment is not consistent even if you work hard on project.,24
#NAME?,19
1. Don't join for onsite opportunity. There are very few onsite positions. 2. Infrastructure is not that good like other big companies. 3. You won't be promoted to next level as easy as possible.,0
"Some old folks are are not having technical knowledge, Still they have higher technical responsibilities.",14
"1.Managers are biased. 2.No value of employees. 3.Worst leaders who don't support you. 4.demotivating management. 5.no transparency with the employees. 6.No cultural diversity(dominantly marathi speaking people driven organization) 7.No empathy with employees. 8.No job security. 9.Policies should be same for all the employees. 10.No empathy with employee's condition,sickness and personal life only priority is personal work. 11.Ruthless client and HR supports them. 12.Revenge taking manangers at client side. 13.employee is made to work at client location as contracters where they are treated as dogs.",34
"Infrastructure is not that great when compared with MNCs, work and work culture at client locations is not that good, WFH is very difficult",16
Please do not join if you are an UI developer as there are no opportunities to grow. Project will be assigned to you for sake of billing but no work.,0
"Very bad management, they will make you to ""Go to hell""",24
Bad work managers Bad work environment No place to growth No career opportunity,24
"hired us via campus interviews, even gave us joining but cancelled offer letter after making us wait for a year.",25
Some managers are so insecure that they do not have the guts to accept a new idea or a confident person. They should really introspect,26
Limited projects are available Stagnancy if you don't keep up to date yourdself,9
Really bad working environment full of bad politics. There US counterpart treat employees have no respect for Indian employees. No job stability at all,24
Middle Management and few Senior Management people are not open to ideas,26
Does projects only in Chicago. Expanding beyond Chicago could definitely add more to the growth!,34
Not anything I can think of.,1
"Processes, higher mgt - little politics",17
"It was an on campus job.They gave us offer,postponed it two times,making us wait for a year and after a year they cancelled the offer.",25
Manager oriented No employee value No hike No work life balance No vacations Most of the weekend they will ask you to come to office No hike Biased for local people.,13
no cons as of yet,27
I don't have any cons to share.,22
Odd culture. Still trying to establish,12
Pay amount isnt the best,30
Sometimes unsure of direction of company,28
Lack of other possibilities when working in a small town.,23
None that I can think of,29
The environment tends to have a siloed feel if you don't reach out to others.,24
Pay is not the greatest,30
"The Fort Collins office in particular is neglected by the company. They have had trouble keeping any non-billable employees on payroll there to ensure basic day-to-day needs are met. HR in particular is a pain point because they are located in other offices and do not see the Fort Collins office as a priority. Xpanxion corporate and sales seem to understand very little of what their engineers actually do for their clients and as such push a lot of unnecessary or irrelevant certifications or trainings just so they can squeeze a few more dollars out of the client, which of course is not reflected in your own pay.",31
Company direction going the wrong way. Local management has no say in anything.,28
Need to continue pushing for larger contracts,7
"It's true that Xpanxion compensation is not as high as some other companies in the software dev and testing business, even in Nebraska. For some people the extra relaxed environment and lots of PTO is worth a smaller salary, but if a high salary is your greater concern, Xpanxion might not meet that need as well as some other places. There have been some concerns lately that Xpanxion's culture could be changing under influence from the parent company UST. However, there is a lot of evidence that Xpanxion is pushing back against this and trying to solidify the Xpanxion culture and standards. They have also been willing to admit when they made mistakes and try to correct it. There has been some communication trouble lately, but this is one thing that upper management has admitted to being a problem and there are steps being made to rectify this. I hope to see those steps come through and am already seeing better communication lately.",31
No Cabs facility Bad food quality at Cafeteria,9
Limited customer base for the company,28
"1. Management is pretty clueless. One director was barely 5 years out of college. 2. No matching 401k, benefits are abysmal. 3. If your project sucks, well that's too bad. There's not much you can do about it. 4. Management refuses to get good equipment for devs. 5. Too much focus on culture...ugh nobody CARES. 6. Bait and switch tactics -- many people leave because of this 7. Absolutely don't care about retaining engineering talent 8. You can only take 5 days off at a time. Completely ridiculous. Getting approved for more requires AVP approval. Give me a break.",2
None that I can think of.,29
"Some minor cultural pains as the company finds new identity to match growth Leadership is not directly involved with many newer (or long-time) employees Floating from project to project is difficult, making it hard to get a new position without a closed contract",2
"1) Working at client location can be tough. 2) Micro management in few projects. 3) In few projects, things are driven by UST Global management. It does not work in favor of Xpanxion employees. 4) Not many projects into mobility. 5) Though the new office near Pune station is good, it is not a very convenient location for people from other parts of the city.",16
If you get assigned to a weak project you might get stuck there since there is a lot of incentive to keep trained people in place.,18
"Communication between offices and from the headquarters to the offices could use some work; however, this is true for a lot of companies I have worked for.",31
As in all consulting/services companies you are a slave to the client.,28
"The main thing was lack of communication. I was there for a while and I never actually felt I was heard. They have various clients you could be placed with and I was placed with Equifax. Communication was horrible, you had to say something a few times before an action is taken if its taken at all. When I initially got hired, I was told I would get a yearly bonus of about 3-4% of my salary, I never got up to that, I got quartley bonus of 90 - 180 bucks each quarter and during the holidays would get about 200-300 as holiday bonus. I only got a raise once while I was there and they paid lower than the market rate.",32
"The company did go through an acquisition last year, and some things have started to change from the fun startup feel to more of a corporate feeling.",15
"Too much focus on automation and not on development. If you are primarily a developer, make sure you understand what automation is before you start, at the risk of getting bored.",0
"Uncertainty surrounding the start of new projects can be hectic. You always have a lot of things that are outside your control during this time. It's a con, but not a bad one.",10
The only way to move to a different area is to teach yourself the required skills. There is no company training to help an employee move to a different role. In order to move up the ladder you must be a person who brags about what you do and how well you do it. If an employee gives 110% but doesn't brag about their accomplishments then that person is overlooked and thought not to have enough skills to move forward. Compensation is horrible for the amount of work and the skill set of the employees.,34
"Rural offices are farther away from metropolitan areas. Living accommodations are difficult to arrange in rural areas, so additional time is necessary to plan relocation.",33
Upper management really did not care at all about the individual employees or offices. They didn't contact you unless something went wrong and the organization as a whole was terrible. I feel like the staff also drank everyday to make themselves feel better. Often times they would lure employees away from other jobs and then let them go as soon as their project was finished.,32
"no 401k match, i believe this is something trying to be changed though.",35
* Rural attitude in the rural offices - this could be a pro depending,33
A bit too much management turnover in last couple of years.,3
"Bonus is ""false advertising"". There's no way to ever get more than 50% of the advertised bonus because the targets are impossible to achieve.",32
"May or may not be a con, but a large part of the workforce is offshore in India, so the company may have a negative stigma attached.",28
"These are my personal feelings, and may not reflect the experiences of others, or the overall work atmosphere at Xpanxion. However... It seems to me that Xpanxion does not care about anything except billable hours. Some employees are overworked and stressed, others are bored and under-utilized. If the client is happy, management does not care if the employees are not. My concerns were given lip service, and then subsequently dropped. It was my experience that productivity takes a backseat to culture. Management seems perfectly fine with someone who comes in to play ping pong and video games as long as they bill eight hours of work. For some people, this works just fine. Those who would rather work in a peaceful environment are punished, and end up in meetings with HR. Additionally, I feel that management does a poor job of listening to the concerns of their employees, because if the client is happy, then there is no reason for them to address these concerns. They also change their rules, even after agreeing to things with their employees. I know certain rules were changed on me at least three times. The rules are also not consistent between employees. Some employees are allowed to do things that others are not. It seems that the rules are applied on a case by case basis, based on popularity. Xpanxion could be a great place to work, if you fit their mold. But if you do not, you will probably end up very unhappy. My advice to individuals considering a job at Xpanxion is to think about the work environment you like. If you want a lighthearted office culture that values fun over productivity, this might be a good place for you. But if the thought of being hit in the eye with a NERF dart while trying to solve a difficult problem does not sound like a great time, you might want to look elsewhere.",34
Low salary No 401k match Leadership is a joke,35
"Relaxed work environment Pay is not as competitive as it is in larger cities, although work is performed for global clientele.",24
"While working for Xpanxion, I was subject to ongoing workplace sexual harassment. For a time, I routinely had my boss on my project making jokes about sex acts involving my manager and me. When I reported this to my office manager, my office manager cut me off rather than hear out my complaints, and later attempted to cover for the offending party by recommending that they lie and describe the situation to HR as a one-time thing rather than a pattern. The office manager seemed intent on maintaining the workplace environment that was full of all sorts of inappropriate and unprofessional conversations about things like sex and serial murder. Reporting these things to HR did very little. HR has not seemed at all interested in correcting problems in the workplace, but really just exists to protect the company from legal action. Aside from the issues with harassment and the unprofessional work environment, Xpanxion has a lot of shortcomings in other ways. I would urge caution regarding anything listed in a job posting, like the claims about their training programs, competitive salaries, and room for growth. My experience with those things has not fit with what they claim. Sadly, working with Xpanxion also becomes an exercise in double and triple checking everything, and sometimes still having to correct issues after doing that. You can't really trust anything that is told or promised to you by Xpanxion. It's not uncommon to be told one thing only to have it change later, or to have mistakes made like tax withheld for the wrong state. I guess stuff usually gets figured out in the end, but these sorts of mistakes are very common and cause quite a bit of hassle.",34
"Nothing bad to say, I've had a great experience.",24
There are no cons to employment here that I have experienced.,22
"Stressful projects and I never felt like my manager was completely honest with me. Most of the time all I got from them in terms of a response was ""I was fine"", which apparently wasn't the case since I'm terminated.",32
None that I could find yet,27
"No 401k Match, lack of communication to employees",23
"Good company to start your career with but not a good place to stay. HR was very rude and unprofessional. Was selling products from her own business products at work and harassing people to buy it. Also, the management is not sensitive to your needs. They really don't care about you.",24
Communication Pay vs others in Industry,30
The PTO policy can use some improvement.,31
"Project turn around rates, or cancelations.",2
Need to have more Java projects,36
Communication can be improved in some areas.,3
Several leadership changes to accommodate growth.,35
Training program could use some work,31
I havent found any yet.,20
Lack of growth and good core technology work. Also growth in the last decase has not been very significant,23
