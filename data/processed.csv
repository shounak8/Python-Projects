I had joined this organization as a fresher and can gladly say that this is THE Company. There are mulitple reasons for me to continue to be associated with Xpanxion. It gives me the freedom and flexibility to voice my opinion with Sr. Mgmt and I have personally seen my feedback and opinion being acted upon positively. I have got exposure as well as support to work on various niche technologies and the company has a very good policy of allocating 2.5 hours of work time for personal and professional development per week. I was able to upgrade my skills and I am currently working on some cool features for a product company who is our esteemed client. I get to interact directly with client, which provides me an opportunity to hone my client facing skills as I aspire to get into a Technical Project Manager role eventually. The management takes a serious view on teams sitting late and ensures that the associates are able to maintain a better work-life balance. I think the greatest example I can quote about the greatness of this company is where employees quit Xpanxion but returned back to join as they felt that they missed the ""Personal Touch"" in the new organization they had joined. I got to go now as I am preparing for a demo and pretty excited about conducting this demo for the client.",As with all companies Xpanxion is not a perfect company. There are opportunities for improvement and that is where I reach out to our Senior Management for providing suggestions.

The resource management team works to find you work as per your aspirations and it's relatively fast when a project change is asked for if you feel your aspirations are different, like in my case I wanted to manage teams than be on tech, I got the opportunity. 4. They are growing and it's evident that Thier employees are a part of that growth story because people from delivery are also involved in strategy. 5. Fast track promotions, even back to back if you do well, management doesn't look at the years of experience but skill when promoting. 6. Fun place to work at, sometimes too many cultural events 7. People are driven here and focussed, management is empathetic towards the employees. 8. Learning is good as they conduct a lot of sessions from technology and behaviourial aspect. 9.

Infrastructure in the aundh office is old but the one at Pune station is good, again no game room in aundh office, a TV in the pantry or canteen will be great :). 3. The AHM or town halls can be boring, the management needs to make it more interesting so that people understand where the company is moving and where it is now. 4. Work life balance 5. Poor integration between the various locations especially for training, need to invest in technology there. 6.

For the most part, the community and culture are very supportive and there's a lot of opportunities to make friends of your coworkers. We get a lot of PTO and it's very flexible in general. This PTO can be used for either vacation or sick days, which I love because it helps meet the needs of different kinds of people. This company is very willing to work with your individual needs and direct management at least makes it clear that they respect you as a professional and an individual. We are getting 401k matching soon, which was one of the last things I was really missing from this company.","It's true that Xpanxion compensation is not as high as some other companies in the software dev and testing business, even in Nebraska. For some people the extra relaxed environment and lots of PTO is worth a smaller salary, but if a high salary is your greater concern, Xpanxion might not meet that need as well as some other places. There have been some concerns lately that Xpanxion's culture could be changing under influence from the parent company UST. However, there is a lot of evidence that Xpanxion is pushing back against this and trying to solidify the Xpanxion culture and standards. They have also been willing to admit when they made mistakes and try to correct it. There has been some communication trouble lately, but this is one thing that upper management has admitted to being a problem and there are steps being made to rectify this. I hope to see those steps come through and am already seeing better communication lately.",1,2018-11-09,positive,2018

There are also video games to play, and a ping pong table.","These are my personal feelings, and may not reflect the experiences of others, or the overall work atmosphere at Xpanxion. However... It seems to me that Xpanxion does not care about anything except billable hours. Some employees are overworked and stressed, others are bored and under-utilized. If the client is happy, management does not care if the employees are not. My concerns were given lip service, and then subsequently dropped. It was my experience that productivity takes a backseat to culture. Management seems perfectly fine with someone who comes in to play ping pong and video games as long as they bill eight hours of work. For some people, this works just fine. Those who would rather work in a peaceful environment are punished, and end up in meetings with HR. Additionally, I feel that management does a poor job of listening to the concerns of their employees, because if the client is happy, then there is no reason for them to address these concerns. They also change their rules, even after agreeing to things with their employees. I know certain rules were changed on me at least three times. The rules are also not consistent between employees. Some employees are allowed to do things that others are not. It seems that the rules are applied on a case by case basis, based on popularity. Xpanxion could be a great place to work, if you fit their mold. But if you do not, you will probably end up very unhappy. My advice to individuals considering a job at Xpanxion is to think about the work environment you like. If you want a lighthearted office culture that values fun over productivity, this might be a good place for you. But if the thought of being hit in the eye with a NERF dart while trying to solve a difficult problem does not sound like a great time, you might want to look elsewhere.",1,2015-07-02,neutral,2015

214,1,Current Employee,"Sexual Harassment, Cover Up, Lies, Mistakes", Anonymous Employee ,Some very good people. Good client/project work in my experience (may vary widely by client/project).,"While working for Xpanxion, I was subject to ongoing workplace sexual harassment. For a time, I routinely had my boss on my project making jokes about sex acts involving my manager and me. When I reported this to my office manager, my office manager cut me off rather than hear out my complaints, and later attempted to cover for the offending party by recommending that they lie and describe the situation to HR as a one-time thing rather than a pattern. The office manager seemed intent on maintaining the workplace environment that was full of all sorts of inappropriate and unprofessional conversations about things like sex and serial murder. Reporting these things to HR did very little. HR has not seemed at all interested in correcting problems in the workplace, but really just exists to protect the company from legal action. Aside from the issues with harassment and the unprofessional work environment, Xpanxion has a lot of shortcomings in other ways. I would urge caution regarding anything listed in a job posting, like the claims about their training programs, competitive salaries, and room for growth. My experience with those things has not fit with what they claim. Sadly, working with Xpanxion also becomes an exercise in double and triple checking everything, and sometimes still having to correct issues after doing that. You can't really trust anything that is told or promised to you by Xpanxion. It's not uncommon to be told one thing only to have it change later, or to have mistakes made like tax withheld for the wrong state. I guess stuff usually gets figured out in the end, but these sorts of mistakes are very common and cause quite a bit of hassle.",0,2017-12-29,negative,2017
