Dear all,
This is the classic snake game which I used to play on my father's Nokia phone back in the days.
This application is based on Turtle library.

main.py       - compiling the codes from library and supporting files
food.py       - contains code for food pellets
snake.py      - contains the code for snake and its growth upon eating the food
scoreboard.py - displays the score of the user

game_over.jpg	   - screenshot of the game ending

Thank you for viewing my code.
